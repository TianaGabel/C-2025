b is base test, very simple example file given

Expected = -83
error line 81, is an incorrect checksum on line 81 (82 with traditional indexing)

success 40x50 is a 40x50 image file with a correct checksum file
success formatting is a 40x10 image with lots of variety in spacing, newlines, etc

For -1 tests, I deleted or swapped data from the image header, pixel values, or changed file extensions.
